# Ilias Laoukili Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages.

The site is completely static and built with HTML, CSS and a small JavaScript file for basic interactivity and language switching. Basic tests are included to verify the theme switcher logic.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the tests:

```bash
npm install   # none required but keeps npm happy
npm test
```
